		div.main If you only care about 8th notes, and strum down on even 8ths, and up on odd 8ths, you can enumerate all the possible simple strums! Since we have 8 binary choices, we get 2^8 possible strums. We can count up from 0 to 256 in binary and treat a 1 as 'hit the strum at this position'. So here they all are! Click a strum pattern to start playing a sample, use the stop sign to stop it. Fun fact; using this system the 'island strum' is the 183rd strum.
