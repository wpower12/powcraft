# Forces
One of the earliest things I made in javascript. It's got a lot of warts that should be refactored. Hasn't been touched in ages. Shows my misunderstanding of a bunch of core ES concepts, specifically how the 'this' keyword, and classes work.

Keeping it for now because of the work it'd take to refactor it. I'd love to properly separate all the classes in the blob into properly defined classes. Also, the input handling could all probably be redone into something more sane.
